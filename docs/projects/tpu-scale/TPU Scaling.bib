  abstract = {This study explores the use of an automated cyber-physical system (CPS) framework for the design and optimization of tall building dynamics through aeroelastic boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) testing. The framework is fully automated, integrating experimental BLWT modeling with numerical optimization algorithms to rapidly evaluate a wide range of candidate designs. In this study, candidate tall building designs are generated by physically adjusting the dynamic properties of a multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) aeroelastic model. The specimen is equipped with an actuation system consisting of a series of variable stiffness devices (VSD), which enable precise control of the lower natural frequencies. The specimen is also instrumented with accelerometers and displacement sensors to capture wind-induced building response. A stochastic optimization algorithm evaluates the fitness of each candidate design based on code-based and/or user-specified serviceability limit states related to occupant comfort and building drift (e.g., sway). Wind tunnel experiments were conducted at the University of Florida Natural Hazard Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Experimental Facility. Results show that the CPS framework can reliably drive the aeroelastic specimen to the optimal solution which minimizes stiffness (i.e., natural frequency) while satisfying multiple acceleration and drift constraints.},

  abstract = {Cyclone and Hurricanes are one of the natural causes of devastating forces. Many destructive cyclone such as Cyclone Vayu (2019), Cyclone Fani (2019), Cyclone Gaja (2018), Cyclone Nilofar (2014), Cyclone Phailin (2013) and others have affected major cities with heavily occupied residential or business areas. Due to these natural calamities buildings are affected to a great extent causing major loss to individuals and nation. This necessitate development of some reliable method for assessment of the building under expected level of wind storms. Wind Performance Based analysis approach is used to predict the performance of the building under extreme wind events. For performance based analysis primarily wind time history data are required as input parameter. In practice, various procedures like Anemometers, Doppler radar and Laser-based LIDAR or wind tunnel test are used for esti­ mating wind time history data. However, all these procedures are time consuming and expen­ sive. As an alternate to these methods an analytical procedure for generation of wind time history point load data is presented in this paper. Aerodynamic database developed by TPU (Tokyo Polytechnic University) is adopted for generation of wind time history data. TPU aerodynamic database provides wind pressure data of low-rise and high-rise building based upon wind tunnel tests. An example is presented to illustrate the procedure to generate wind time history.},

  abstract = {Tall buildings have been traditionally designed to be symmetric rectangular, triangular or circular in plan, in order to avoid excessive seismic-induced torsional vibrations due to eccentricity, especially in seismic-prone regions like Japan. However, recent tall building design has been released from the spell of compulsory symmetric shape design, and free-style design is increasing. This is mainly due to architects’ and structural designers’ challenging demands for novel and unconventional expressions. Another important aspect is that rather complicated sectional shapes are basically good with regard to aerodynamic properties for crosswind excitations, which are a key issue in tall-building wind-resistant design. A series of wind tunnel experiments have been carried out to determine aerodynamic forces and wind pressures acting on square-plan tall building models with various configurations: corner cut, setbacks, helical and so on. The results of these experiments have led to comprehensive understanding of the aerodynamic characteristics of tall buildings with various configurations.},

  abstract = {Standard provisions for wind loads on buildings have traditionally been based on summary tables and/or plots suitable for slide-rule calculations. The accuracy in the definition of wind loads inherent in such tables and plots is far lower than that inherent in current methods for stress computation. Advances in computational power now make it possible to reduce this discrepancy and achieve structural designs for wind that are significantly safer and more economical than current designs. This is true both for routine, low-rise structures and for flexible structures experiencing significant dynamic effects. In this paper, we present the concept of database-assisted design (DAD) along with a discussion of the application software Wind Load Design Environment, a user-friendly tool for designers and code writers that employs the DAD approach. The DAD approach entails the use of large databases of aerodynamic pressures, the optional use of databases of directional extreme wind speeds, and the use of structural information needed for the description of linear or nonlinear structural behavior. We present progress achieved to date, describe current efforts and future needs, and discuss the implications of DAD for reliability-based design and performance-based standards development.},
