## 1. [Example Docs]()

Six new `.rst` example files where created for quoFEM. These `.rst` files are automatically generated by the Python routine that is currently held [here](), based on entries in a Yaml configuration file,  [`conf.yml`](). These entries are currently expected to be written in pandoc markdown.

Changes to the layout and formatting of these examples should be made to the template file [`base.rst`](), and changes in content should be made either in [`conf.yml`](), or the newly created JSON Schema (see [JSON Schema](#3.-JSON-Schema)).
