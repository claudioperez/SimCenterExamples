As a consequence, no postprocessing script is needed. The values placed in `results.out` file are the difference between computed and observed values. Expressed another way, the function `f(m1,m2)` computed and written to the `results.out` file is `f(m1,m2) = ObservedPeriods - ComputedPeriods(m1,m2)`. The UQ algorithm when running is searching for values of the random variable parameters (`m1` and `m2`) that minimize this loss function. The user must take this fact into account when formulating the output from their own scripts for their own problems.

    docs: &rosenbrock
      synopsis: This example illustrates how Python scripting can be used with quoFEM to express general mathematical models without the use of a dedicated finite element analysis engine. 
      statement: >
        The Rosenbrock function is a *test function* that is often used to evaluate numerical optimization algorithms. It is given by the following expression:

        $$
        f(x, y)=(a-x)^{2}+b\left(y-x^{2}\right)^{2}
        $$
        
        Using a forward propagation procedure, 
      workflow: |
        For this forward propagation problem, we need to define a Python script that will import a set of random variable values, apply them to the Rosenmbrock function, then write the results to a file named `results.out` for every random variable realization generated by Dakota. To this end, we begin by defining our random variables as Python objects as follows, and supplying this as a `.py` script in the **Parameters File** field of the **FEM** tab.:

        ```python
        var1 = None
        var2 = None
        ```

        Although this file will later be used as a Python module, it is important to note that in the quoFEM workflow, it is NOT handled as a true Python script. Rather, it can be thought of loosely as analogous to a C "header file" in that it simply gives us an interface to Dakota from Python. The values assigned to the variables at this point will not be used.

        > **Note**: The **Parameters File** is not a true Python script; For the time being, until further documentation about the tool is developed, users should only use line-by-line variable definitions in this file. Python assignments like `var1, var2 = None, None` are not supported. 

        We can now implement our model for the **Input File** which will begin with a star-import from the parameters file we just created. Assuming that file was named `params.py`, this import would look like so:
      
        ```python 
        from params import *
        ``` 

        Next we define the following simple function which evaluates the Rosenbrock function:

        ```python 
        def rosenbrock(x, y):
            a = 1.
            b = 100.
            return (a - x)**2.0 + b*(y - x**2.)**2.
        ``` 

        Finally, we apply our `rosenbrock` function to the variables we imported from `params`, and write the results to a file called `results.out`. Note that throughout the forward propagation routine, the values assigned to the variables `var1` and `var2` in the  `params` interface are varied by the workflow application.

        ```python
        with open('results.out', 'w') as f:
            result = rosenbrock(var1, var2)
            f.write('{:.60g}'.format(result))
        ```

        The code from these steps is colleted and made available for download in the following files:

    docs:
      synopsis: In this example, a parameter estimation routine is used to estimate the story masses of a simple steel frame, given data about it's mode shapes.
      statement: |
        Provided by Professor Joel Conte and his doctoral students Maitreya Kurumbhati and Mukesh Ramancha from UC San Diego, this example looks at the following simplified finite element model of a steel building.

        ![](frame/frameFE.png) \
        
        Each floor slab of the building is made of composite metal deck and is supported on four steel columns. The story heights are measured at $10'$ and in plan the side lengths measure $33'-4"$ by $30'$. Properties of the steel columns are taken deterministically  with an elastic modulus of $29,000 \mathrm{ksi}$, area of $110 \mathrm{in}^2$, and principal moment of inertial ($I_{xx}$) of $1190 \mathrm{in}^4$. For modelling purposes, the four columns are assumed fixed at the base and the beams connecting them are assumed to be rigid. The first two vibration periods of the structure are determined to be $0.19 sec$ and $0.09 sec$. 
        
        The unknown quantities of interest are the lumped first and second story masses (`m1` and `m2` respectively). Using the following bounds and initial estimates, these parameters are defined as follows in the **RV** tab of quoFEM:

        ## Results

        Once the analysis is complete the **RES** tab will be automatically selected and the results will be displayed as shown in the figure below. The figure shows that Dakota returned estimates of our unknown parameters to be $m1=0.515549$ and $m2=0.256492$.
