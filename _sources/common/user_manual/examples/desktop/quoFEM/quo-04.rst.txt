   Consider the problem of uncertainty quantification in a two-dimensional truss structure shown in the following figure.

   .. figure:: figures/truss.png
      :align: center
      :width: 600
      :figclass: align-center

   The goal of the exercise is to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the vertical displacement at node 3. The exercise requires two files. The user is required to download these files and place them in a **NEW** folder. The two files are: 

   1. `TrussTemplate.tcl <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/quoFEM/blob/master/examples/exampleOpenSeesForward/TrussTemplate.tcl>`_ 

   .. literalinclude:: TrussTemplate.tcl
      :language: tcl

   .. note::
      
      1. The first lines containing ``pset`` will be read by the application when the file is selected and the application will autopopulate the Random Variables input panel with these same variable names. It is of course possible to explicitly use Random Variables without the ``pset`` command as is demonstrated in the verification section.

   2. `postprocess.tcl <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/quoFEM/blob/master/examples/exampleOpenSeesForward/postprocess.tcl>`_. 

   The postprocess.tcl script shown below will accept as input any of the 6 nodes in the domain and for each of the two dof directions.

   .. literalinclude:: postprocess.tcl
      :language: tcl

   .. note::

      The use has the option to provide no postprocess script (in which case the main script must create a results.out file containing a single line with as many space separated numbers as QoI or the user may provide a python script that also performs the postprocessing. An example of a postprocessing python script is `postprocess.py <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/quoFEM/blob/master/examples/exampleOpenSeesForward/postprocess.py>`_. 

      .. literalinclude:: postprocess.py
         :language: python


   Global Sensitivity
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   In a global sensitivity analysis the user is wishing to understand what is the influence of the individual random variables on the quantities of interest. This is typically done before the user launches large scale forward uncertainty problems in order to limit the number of random variables used so as to limit the number of simulations performed.

   To perform a reliability analysis the steps above would be repeated with the exception that the user would select a reliability analysis method instead of a Forward Propagation method. To obtain reliability results using the Second-Order Reliability Method (SORM) for the truss problem the user would follow the same sequence of steps as previously. The difference would be in the UQ tab in which the user would select a Reliability as the Dakota Method Category and then choose Local reliability. In the figure the user is specifying that they are interested in the probability that the displacement will exceed certain response levels.

      :figclass: align-center

   After the user fills in the rest of the tabs as per the previous section, the user would then press the ''RUN'' button. The application (after spinning for a while with the wheel of death) will present the user with the results.
